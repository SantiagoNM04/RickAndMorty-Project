# RickAndMorty-Project
This is a Project created with React JS and an API that get Rick and Morty characters to show information in the site

In order to make this web application faster I used React + Vite, complementing it with some things for a responsive design with Bootstrap.

To see the project on your PC, you must run the application with "npm run dev" since it is a project created in conjunction with Vite, this command will run it on a Localhost so you can interact with it.
